# Discord TTS Bot

This is a simple TTS Bot that uses the Google Translate TTS API. With this bot you can send Text-to-Speech messages in multiple languages.

## Requirements

To self-host this bot you'll need the following:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 12.0.0 or higher)
* ffmpeg

**ffmpeg** should be installed by default on Linux and MacOS, in case it isn't, install it with your package manager. For Windows users, head over to [ffmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) to download the binary which will need to be added to your **\$PATH**. If you don't know how to add folders to your **\$PATH**, check out this [guide](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

## Installation

In order to self-host this bot, first you'll need to clone this repository.

    git clone https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-tts-bot.git

Then, inside the `config` folder, rename the file *settings.json.example* to *settings.json* and edit the file with your own Discord Token and the prefix you wish to use. If you don't have a discord token yet, you can see a guide on how to create it [here](https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-downtime-notifier/wiki). Your file should look like this.

    {
      "discord_token": "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN",
      "prefix": "$",
      "allow_more_than_200_chars": "yes"
    }

The `allow_more_than_200_chars` property lets you choose wether you want TTS messages longer than 200 characters to be played (default: `yes`).

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

You can now run your bot:

    npm start
